0:0:45,583 --> 0:0:49,125
With programming it's a... 
you can do whatever you want. 

3
0:0:49,291 --> 0:0:52,916
And at some point you, it's...

4
0:0:53,458 --> 0:0:56,875
Um, I wouldn't say biblical, but it's like 
there's nothing in the beginning 

5
0:0:57,208 --> 0:1:0,125
Or, or just as you have in history 
it's just an empty space 

6
0:1:0,750 --> 0:1:2,875
and you can start throwing things in there. 

7
0:1:5,208 --> 0:1:8,458
Well, what I want to do when I,
I want to program like I can think. 

8
0:1:8,541 --> 0:1:14,625
So like ten years ago I painted a lot,
and I want to get the same feeling with code. 

9
0:1:16,583 --> 0:1:18,416
Programming is like a superpower. 

10
0:1:18,708 --> 0:1:21,916
There's so many things that you want to do 
that you could do by hand 

11
0:1:22,0 --> 0:1:26,750
and it would take you a long time but if,
like, programming just increases your capabilities

12
0:1:27,125 --> 0:1:28,916
you know, almost exponentially. 

13
0:1:31,708 --> 0:1:34,41
I've always been fascinated by computers. 

14
0:1:34,250 --> 0:1:37,708
I think Jobs, quite, is particularly interesting. 

15
0:1:37,833 --> 0:1:41,125
You know, saying that computers
are bicycles for the mind. 

16
0:1:41,333 --> 0:1:44,333
You know just a human on it's own is just a human. 

17
0:1:44,458 --> 0:1:49,750
But with the addition of a bicycle
we'll become the most efficient biped out there. 

18
0:1:50,83 --> 0:1:52,791
And the computer I think holds 
the same thing in terms of 

19
0:1:52,833 --> 0:1:55,125
the possibilities of what we can do with our creativity. 

20
0:1:55,375 --> 0:1:59,291
And when you have that computer to support you 
you can create incredible things. 

21
0:2:0,750 --> 0:2:2,83
I addicted myself.

22
0:2:2,958 --> 0:2:8,625
And, I'm highly addicted to programming.
You can't stop me, sometimes I forget to eat.

23
0:2:9,125 --> 0:2:10,250
Sometimes I forget to sleep.

24
0:2:10,791 --> 0:2:12,458
And...

25
0:2:14,333 --> 0:2:16,583
I don't know, can you turn a pickle back into a cucumber?

26
0:2:16,833 --> 0:2:20,791
Probably not. So I'm here for life.
You've got me, it's terminal. 

27
0:2:24,708 --> 0:2:27,125
You are sculpting possibility space.

28
0:2:27,333 --> 0:2:31,333
Which sounds big, but in a way that's what it is.

29
0:2:31,666 --> 0:2:36,791
You're adding with those little lego bricks
of code and language that you have.

30
0:2:37,416 --> 0:2:40,666
Put them together and you add more possibilities.

31
0:2:40,833 --> 0:2:46,208
And with every new brick, basically
your possibilities increase, uh, many times.

32
0:2:46,250 --> 0:2:52,458
And that's, in a way this adding and taking away,
that's kind of the design process now.

33
0:2:52,708 --> 0:2:55,41
It'sÉ I still feel in control.

34
0:2:55,250 --> 0:2:58,666
Uh, but I like to be surprised.
I think that's the beauty of it.

35
0:2:59,0 --> 0:3:4,750
Um, the thing when a system goes beyond
what you naturally understand it to do.

36
0:3:4,833 --> 0:3:8,125
And sometimes you have something that surprises you.

37
0:3:8,916 --> 0:3:11,250
And I always look for that, that one moment, basically.

38
0:3:11,916 --> 0:3:14,958
In my practice as an artist,
I've always been interested about the universe

39
0:3:15,41 --> 0:3:20,41
and the scale of the universe that's around us.
Especially in comparison to us.

40
0:3:20,375 --> 0:3:24,666
And, uh, and I think kind of the commercial work that I do

41
0:3:24,708 --> 0:3:27,333
it's really about trying to take people into the moment.

42
0:3:27,500 --> 0:3:30,541
I'm really trying to get people into that kind of feeling

43
0:3:30,666 --> 0:3:33,83
where you're not thinking about your past, or your future.

44
0:3:33,291 --> 0:3:34,666
That you're really in the now.

45
0:3:41,0 --> 0:3:42,83
[clears his throat]

46
0:3:42,666 --> 0:3:44,83
I dream in code.

47
0:3:44,791 --> 0:3:46,333
One time I woke up and I said:

48
0:3:47,333 --> 0:3:48,958
Rebecca! What time is it?
And then I said:

49
0:3:49,333 --> 0:3:52,708
I think it's January 11111111111!
Like that.

50
0:3:53,958 --> 0:3:58,83
In 1999, I was making out with my girlfriend 
Anne Marie

51
0:3:58,791 --> 0:4:0,708
and I fell asleep because I was very tired.

52
0:4:0,875 --> 0:4:5,416
And I could see the function with a block of code
with if then statements and for loops

53
0:4:5,500 --> 0:4:10,0
describing the, um... the kiss.

54
0:4:19,333 --> 0:4:24,958
I think, coding and technology in general
informatic technology is the thing

55
0:4:25,0 --> 0:4:29,166
that defines our time right now
and as an artist, I feel like

56
0:4:29,458 --> 0:4:34,83
my job is to explore this stuff that defines our time right now.

57
0:4:34,541 --> 0:4:37,500
Not the stuff that defined our time 100 years ago.

58
0:4:37,625 --> 0:4:40,0
So, I just got into it naturally.

59
0:4:43,583 --> 0:4:47,583
You know we have people who write demos in 256 bytes. 

60
0:4:47,750 --> 0:4:53,708
These are 256 numbers strung together
to create an image or an animation

61
0:4:54,125 --> 0:4:57,375
and everyone goes WOW, how did they do that?

62
0:4:57,583 --> 0:5:1,375
And this is incredible, because the way actually
you can only achieve this by

63
0:5:1,500 --> 0:5:5,125
knowing every single bit about the technology underneath.

64
0:5:5,333 --> 0:5:12,375
Knowing what command to use in which position
so you can actually reuse the code as data

65
0:5:12,500 --> 0:5:16,41
to create something else.
And it's incredibly cryptic

66
0:5:16,125 --> 0:5:19,708
but it shows incredible mental strength 
and intelligence 

67
0:5:19,750 --> 0:5:21,416
to actually achieve something  like that.

68
0:5:21,666 --> 0:5:27,166
Like it's a way to interface with these things
that's on a very basic level of the way that we

69
0:5:27,500 --> 0:5:32,416
you know, process our experience.
And I think that's like a big problem with software.

70
0:5:32,500 --> 0:5:34,791
It's so abstracted on so many levels.

71
0:5:34,875 --> 0:5:40,916
You know data on it's own is just noise.
If no one processes that data it's meaningless.

72
0:5:41,166 --> 0:5:44,541
It's really just dust, you know?

73
0:5:44,708 --> 0:5:48,0
And that's what I really find interesting about the demo scene

74
0:5:48,41 --> 0:5:50,583
because it's actually, people are really focused

75
0:5:50,750 --> 0:5:55,750
on producing such compressed 
versions of information.

76
0:5:55,791 --> 0:5:57,916
Not data. Code is information.

77
0:5:58,125 --> 0:5:59,541
It's not random noise.

78
0:5:59,750 --> 0:6:6,875
That information can actually create a physical
emotional feedback in the viewer.

79
0:6:7,83 --> 0:6:11,291
And I find this really incredible.
And the code is so microscopic

80
0:6:11,333 --> 0:6:12,791
it can be easily shared.

81
0:6:15,0 --> 0:6:20,416
And it was like, um, I liked it visually.
Just because of the shapes you got.

82
0:6:20,708 --> 0:6:24,916
But I also liked it in a sense of, um
...experimenting.

83
0:6:25,125 --> 0:6:31,41
So it was like, I couldn't do this with actual water in a tank.

84
0:6:31,208 --> 0:6:34,791
But here I can do it on a smaller scale.

85
0:6:35,541 --> 0:6:39,708
And, just imagine what it might look like.

86
0:6:52,291 --> 0:6:55,291
There's a guy I know who made this project

87
0:6:55,666 --> 0:6:57,791
it was just these strings in a box, and it was called Wiremap.

88
0:6:57,958 --> 0:7:1,708
And you were able to present like, 3D objects inside it

89
0:7:2,291 --> 0:7:4,333
like dynamically, using these really cheap materials.

90
0:7:4,375 --> 0:7:5,625
It was really inspiring, it was like

91
0:7:5,875 --> 0:7:10,500
a video projector, which you can get ahold of
almost anywhere now, and some strings in a box.

92
0:7:11,83 --> 0:7:14,916
But all the string's like perfectly laid out,
so each one of them casts, catches

93
0:7:15,250 --> 0:7:17,625
a different column of pixels from the projector.

94
0:7:18,666 --> 0:7:23,875
So I started recreating this project and I worked 
a lot in like how to make it more advanced

95
0:7:23,958 --> 0:7:25,291
in terms of the algorithms behind it.

96
0:7:25,541 --> 0:7:28,208
So there's now an interest in really thinking about interface.

97
0:7:28,250 --> 0:7:30,166
So on one hand that's quite interesting

98
0:7:30,541 --> 0:7:34,958
And then, but I think what's more exciting is that
uh, is the people hacking them.

99
0:7:35,0 --> 0:7:40,500
And that those communities are going to
discover actually the more interesting things.

100
0:7:41,291 --> 0:7:45,416
I think you get to a point in large visualizations where

101
0:7:45,458 --> 0:7:48,375
it's just actually too much data to look at as a flat image

102
0:7:48,416 --> 0:7:55,0
and you have to do some sort of zooming or
you know, flying through navigation to get

103
0:7:55,708 --> 0:8:1,41
I don't know, to focus on some small part of it
because it's, there's so many examples of this like

104
0:8:1,375 --> 0:8:4,916
huge hairball of connections
and like it means nothing, at some point.

105
0:8:5,208 --> 0:8:8,750
And he is basically explaining 
how the database works

106
0:8:9,416 --> 0:8:11,541
and he says there's one point here,

107
0:8:11,875 --> 0:8:15,791
and then you go around and then there is another
audio sample there, and another one there

108
0:8:15,875 --> 0:8:18,916
and because this is closer this is the
one which is matched.

109
0:8:19,0 --> 0:8:20,41
[laughs]

110
0:8:20,208 --> 0:8:22,0
And he explains everything like that.

111
0:8:22,375 --> 0:8:25,750
I think like for a little while people'd still be
doing this thing with augmented reality

112
0:8:25,833 --> 0:8:28,166
where they'd get like an iPad out and
they'd put it in front of something.

113
0:8:28,208 --> 0:8:30,750
but that's just ridiculous.
It's never going to be like that eventually.

114
0:8:30,791 --> 0:8:33,291
It's all going to be about like,
you go around the world

115
0:8:33,333 --> 0:8:34,916
and things happen that 
couldn't have happened before.

116
0:8:35,0 --> 0:8:36,875
You can see something. 
I mean you might be looking

117
0:8:36,916 --> 0:8:39,166
over here and you might, 
this thing might pop up that says

118
0:8:39,625 --> 0:8:40,833
here's a read-out from this thing.

119
0:8:41,83 --> 0:8:43,0
And it'd be perfectly rectified
to the way you're looking at it

120
0:8:43,41 --> 0:8:44,916
but somebody over there won't
 be able to see it at all.

121
0:8:45,458 --> 0:8:48,416
But you won't be wearing anything. You'll just be,

122
0:8:48,458 --> 0:8:50,875
your environment is having this light cast onto it

123
0:8:50,958 --> 0:8:54,750
because it's being scanned 
and projected onto. And, uh

124
0:8:55,541 --> 0:8:58,625
I think that's like, that's gonna be really interesting in the future.

125
0:8:59,750 --> 0:9:4,125
It's very difficult to take your mind 
out of what you are living

126
0:9:4,166 --> 0:9:6,250
where everything is already so fast

127
0:9:6,291 --> 0:9:11,291
and there's always a new app and and a new,
a new innovation and something you want to try

128
0:9:11,666 --> 0:9:17,541
because you just read about it so
also the information like circulates so fast that

129
0:9:17,958 --> 0:9:21,666
yeah, it's um... it's really difficult
to project yourself in the future

130
0:9:21,875 --> 0:9:25,625
because you feel almost like you are already
living in some kind of future.

131
0:9:25,833 --> 0:9:31,416
Even if you fantasize about having 
a more powerful laptop.

132
0:9:32,666 --> 0:9:36,500
Interviewer: "Is there an experience,
a digital experience, that you desire to have?"

133
0:9:36,833 --> 0:9:43,708
Oh yes, tele-transportation. Yeah. That's a, that's
there are many things,

134
0:9:45,791 --> 0:9:50,500
Yeah, there, there are many things, OK.
Some I shouldn't talk about.

135
0:9:50,583 --> 0:9:55,416
But yeah, tele-transportation, it's because, 
you know there was a time when they would say

136
0:9:55,458 --> 0:10:0,666
well with video conferences you won't need 
to meet, but they don't work so well.

137
0:10:1,208 --> 0:10:5,958
You still need to be with the people, to really
discuss and work on projects.

138
0:10:6,41 --> 0:10:11,41
You can do part of it by video conferences,

139
0:10:11,83 --> 0:10:14,250
but it has its limits, so it means I have to travel.

140
0:10:14,291 --> 0:10:17,875
I am sick of traveling. I waste so much time

141
0:10:18,791 --> 0:10:24,291
in the airport, and waiting for trains,
and I cannot work, so, I wish tele-transportation

142
0:10:24,625 --> 0:10:29,500
Is it, is it possible? Is it going to be possible?
I really want that.

143
0:10:32,333 --> 0:10:37,750
You could start off with the point cloud of this.
And then, I don't know, at some point when I say

144
0:10:37,875 --> 0:10:43,833
talking about water or physical systems
all the points could just flush, or

145
0:10:43,875 --> 0:10:45,0
or turn into water, 

146
0:10:45,41 --> 0:10:51,375
or something like that. Just to 
illustrate the thing you've been talking about.

147
0:10:59,750 --> 0:11:4,0
The footage is frameless, so because this
footage is rendered in a 3D environment

148
0:11:4,166 --> 0:11:7,916
and you have to look at it from some perspective
you can browse anywhere in it

149
0:11:7,958 --> 0:11:11,375
you can see just edges of it,
or potentially multiple people

150
0:11:11,750 --> 0:11:14,83
you know like floating heads or whatever,
can be in the same space

151
0:11:14,125 --> 0:11:16,0
or having a conversation that never happened.

152
0:11:16,208 --> 0:11:20,458
Or objects can come in, 
or parts of things can be taken out

153
0:11:20,750 --> 0:11:26,166
um, that can illustrate what they're talking about.
Or even simpler things like that, like 

154
0:11:26,458 --> 0:11:30,666
the faces can fragment, 
or um, the colors can change.

155
0:11:30,875 --> 0:11:34,458
Or the camera angle can change even though
this camera's been completely static.

156
0:11:34,708 --> 0:11:37,750
There's just a lot of room to play.
It's an experimentation.

157
0:11:37,875 --> 0:11:42,41
You don't know what will work. There's no
cinematic language that has evolved yet

158
0:11:42,166 --> 0:11:44,0
so we're sort of at a point to define that.

159
0:11:44,500 --> 0:11:49,708
[quiet overlapping voices]

160
0:11:49,750 --> 0:11:53,875
It's the thing that comes after a video camera.
It's the thing that comes after a camcorder.

161
0:11:54,958 --> 0:11:59,458
It's a Kinect with a digital camera on it,
I guess there's a sound microphone.

162
0:11:59,875 --> 0:12:3,458
And there's this amazing blinding light.

163
0:12:6,708 --> 0:12:10,916
I mean we definitely are stuck in that paradigm.

164
0:12:11,125 --> 0:12:12,541
We're stuck in the mirror world, you know.

165
0:12:13,0 --> 0:12:18,83
Like, I look at this, and I do this, and stare
at myself in the screen that's like in here

166
0:12:18,125 --> 0:12:20,0
you know, so that's an issue.

167
0:12:20,416 --> 0:12:22,833
Andï¿½ I don't know how you could fix that.
This is still a camera

168
0:12:22,958 --> 0:12:30,166
it still has all of the like, dynamics and
kind of set up that a camera makes, so

169
0:12:30,208 --> 0:12:32,666
and like the politics of 
the camera world, you know

170
0:12:33,83 --> 0:12:37,83
I wouldn't want to have that inhibition there.
I wouldn't want to have it sitting there

171
0:12:37,208 --> 0:12:42,333
and reminding me to like, look at the image
the way that the camera looked at it.

172
0:12:42,375 --> 0:12:47,41
I mean, if that's 3D, then let's turn it inside out.
Let's look at it from behind.

173
0:12:47,125 --> 0:12:51,541
Let's break down the image that you get.

174
0:12:52,583 --> 0:12:56,666
For me, I perceive a continuum between
abstraction and figuration.

175
0:12:56,750 --> 0:13:1,333
I see a place all along there where there's a lot
of really interesting places to go

176
0:13:1,416 --> 0:13:3,958
that communicate with us 
in so many interesting ways.

177
0:13:9,500 --> 0:13:13,750
And seeing a host of new aesthetic approaches
coming into wider use

178
0:13:13,791 --> 0:13:18,41
And seeing the very sort of non-photorealistic
aspects of that film

179
0:13:18,875 --> 0:13:23,208
that sort of made me excited for what
we can accomplish if we just sort of

180
0:13:23,625 --> 0:13:29,375
don't worry so much about duplicating reality
and figure out how to create kinds of images

181
0:13:29,625 --> 0:13:31,958
that have never been seen before.

182
0:13:45,791 --> 0:13:49,500
Further into the future I think we could
probably see autonomous cameras

183
0:13:50,500 --> 0:13:54,83
Cameras that can hover, or move on their own.

184
0:13:54,583 --> 0:14:0,41
And paint areas, creating you know
 large sets of data

185
0:14:0,83 --> 0:14:2,625
that you choose camera angles 
out of after the fact.

186
0:14:5,750 --> 0:14:10,583
And, uh, do my own performance, 
and then blend that

187
0:14:11,83 --> 0:14:13,750
with the existing point cloud 
that you give me

188
0:14:14,41 --> 0:14:19,416
so that I'm doing an additional 
layer of extemporaneous performance 

189
0:14:20,291 --> 0:14:21,500
which moves and changes.

190
0:14:21,666 --> 0:14:25,708
One me this month, one me next month.
And maybe another me the month after.

191
0:14:26,750 --> 0:14:30,541
And have a different algorithmic 
treatment per word.

192
0:14:33,583 --> 0:14:38,125
But I just want to try and explore
every path that it opens

193
0:14:38,208 --> 0:14:42,875
And see what connections we can make
and how we can build on that.

194
0:14:44,41 --> 0:14:47,416
I hope there are no limitations and 
I don't think there will be.

195
0:14:47,416 --> 0:14:50,916
The only limitation is time, 
and we probably won't live to 

196
0:14:52,375 --> 0:14:55,125
see things we would think 
is a limitation right now.

197
0:14:55,416 --> 0:14:57,791
But I do think it gets more and more complex

198
0:14:58,375 --> 0:15:4,833
And it's, I mean, it's such a young medium 
as well. And it's evolving so fast

199
0:15:6,83 --> 0:15:8,500
All this computation and power, I mean we...

200
0:15:8,583 --> 0:15:13,708
if you look at where we are with our tools
that we have available , um

201
0:15:14,333 --> 0:15:20,875
we've got the basic needs covered.
The basic input, output, interaction, rendering

202
0:15:21,41 --> 0:15:25,500
That's, that's done. And people
don't predict big advances there.

203
0:15:25,750 --> 0:15:28,625
There's the limit of our physical senses

204
0:15:28,750 --> 0:15:35,125
is kind of the limit of where real and virtual
kind of overlaps and meets.

205
0:15:35,541 --> 0:15:37,83
That's visible.

206
0:15:37,166 --> 0:15:44,250
I mean, Tim Sweeney from Epic Games says that
in 2020, at that point in time we'll have

207
0:15:44,458 --> 0:15:48,541
graphics cards producing, 
and 3D game engines producing

208
0:15:48,750 --> 0:15:53,750
visuals that can fool our eyes believably enough

209
0:15:54,291 --> 0:15:59,708
and, so all this extra computation power 
from then on hopefully will be spent on

210
0:16:0,958 --> 0:16:5,375
developing deeper knowledge systems
that can do something like

211
0:16:5,500 --> 0:16:12,125
modeling consciousness, or create more
complex, deeper interactions.

212
0:16:12,375 --> 0:16:16,708
And I think that's where 
I'd love cinema to go to

213
0:16:17,0 --> 0:16:21,208
where we can play with these virtual actors
and we can interact with them

214
0:16:21,416 --> 0:16:25,458
on a believable, deeper, human level.

215
0:16:26,41 --> 0:16:31,125
Hopefully it'll all resolve into 
one big noble conversation.

216
0:16:31,583 --> 0:16:34,375
And there you can definitely 
see the cumulative effects

217
0:16:34,625 --> 0:16:39,875
of you know, an internet which is, or a network
rather, of millions of neurons.

218
0:16:40,541 --> 0:16:48,458
Kevin Kelly's observations of the complexity of
the entire sphere of connected, um, computers

219
0:16:48,541 --> 0:16:52,458
is approximately right now on the order of
the same size as a single human brain.

220
0:16:52,750 --> 0:16:53,958
And it is going to become 
very interesting when that

221
0:16:54,0 --> 0:16:55,750
becomes a hundred million
 times more complicated.

222
0:16:56,416 --> 0:16:59,250
Um, and that will be like 
the greatest network ever built

223
0:16:59,333 --> 0:17:2,83
and certainly we'll be able to do 
some very interesting things

224
0:17:2,208 --> 0:17:7,833
Um, I think of it as kind of the world 
becoming one mind.

225
0:17:7,916 --> 0:17:11,625
I think it's going to be more like that,
than sort of the computers taking over

226
0:17:11,916 --> 0:17:12,833
and, you know, Skynet.

227
0:17:13,291 --> 0:17:14,916
Um, but maybe I'm an optimist.

228
0:17:15,750 --> 0:17:16,625
Of sorts.

229
0:17:17,291 --> 0:17:21,708
You always feel this layer of artificiality

230
0:17:22,41 --> 0:17:23,750
which I'm, I'm...

231
0:17:24,125 --> 0:17:27,875
I never managed to truly engage and feel comfortable there, so

232
0:17:28,166 --> 0:17:35,541
um, so yeah, a virtual version world would 
be good, but ones I've tested so far have not

233
0:17:36,125 --> 0:17:38,791
I don't think they can replace physicality.

234
0:17:39,41 --> 0:17:41,666
Doesn't mean that physicality cannot be replaced, but

235
0:17:41,708 --> 0:17:45,708
what I've experienced so far 
I was not very impressed.

236
0:17:45,916 --> 0:17:48,875
What if you could capture the thinking of a person?

237
0:17:49,333 --> 0:17:52,458
At one point, and then compare
 it to another point

238
0:17:53,375 --> 0:17:59,41
and like a really beautiful 
multi-complex fractal, in a way.

239
0:17:59,333 --> 0:18:3,0
And ideally I'd like to kind of put two
next to each other 

240
0:18:3,41 --> 0:18:4,375
and compare them or talk to them.

241
0:18:4,458 --> 0:18:5,375
Explore them.

242
0:18:5,791 --> 0:18:7,750
And, maybe that goes a bit far.

243
0:18:8,875 --> 0:18:13,791
In theory you could build the whole universe
inside a computer.

244
0:18:13,958 --> 0:18:15,833
You just don't have enough power and then,

245
0:18:16,458 --> 0:18:19,625
you'll never get there and it would be boring
to build the same thing all over again.

246
0:18:19,750 --> 0:18:21,291
But in theory, you could, and

247
0:18:21,708 --> 0:18:24,125
that's something I find kind of stunning.
